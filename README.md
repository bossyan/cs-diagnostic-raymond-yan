## Problem 2:  Interpreted and Compiled Languages

What is the difference between an interpreted and a compiled language?  What are the strengths and weaknesses of each?  Give an example of each, and list a situation for each where a developer should choose one over the other.  

* The difference between an interpreted and a compiled language is that interpreted language executes on the fly and a compiled language compiles the code into assembly language before it can be executed.

* The strength of interpreted language is that it executes on the fly and easier to implement because you don't have to write a compiler for it.
* The strength of compiled language is that it optimizes the code by converting a language such as C++ to the machine code which makes it run faster performance wise, and it catches error before compiling.

* I'm not sure which situation a developer should choose one over the other. I think it's best if OS applications were using a compiled language and web apps to use interpreted.


## Problem 3:  Algorithm Definition
An algorithm is like deciding how to get to school from your house. There are multiple ways to get to school. You can walk, run, drive, or get a ride. You will pick one of those options based on how fast or slow you want to get there and how you feel at the moment.

For example, let's choose driving, in order to get to school by driving. You would have you ask yourself "Do I have a car?", if Yes, get in the car and drive. If No, choose another option to get to school. Let's say we have a car. We have multiple ways to get to school, do we want to go on the freeway or stop-and-go streets? Once you choose a way to get to school, you have to figure out if there's traffic or not and whether you want to be in traffic. Once you decide, you will get to your final destination.
